      <vulnerable range="lt">1.70</vulnerable>

  <background>
    <p>
    XnView is software to view and convert graphics files. XPixMap (XPM) is
    a simple ascii-based graphics format.

  <description>
    <p>
    XnView is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow while processing
    an XPM file with an overly long section string (greater than 1024
    bytes).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted XPM file
    with XnView that could trigger the vulnerability and possibly execute
    arbitrary code with the rights of the user running XnView.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    No update appears to be forthcoming from the XnView developer and
    XnView is proprietary, so the XnView package has been masked in
    Portage. We recommend that users select an alternate graphics viewer
    and conversion utility, and unmerge XnView:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge xnview</code>
