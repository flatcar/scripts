  <background>
    <p>
    mgv is a Postscript viewer with a Motif interface, based on Ghostview
    and GNU gv.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    mgv includes code from gv that does not properly boundary check
    user-supplied data before copying it into process buffers.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Postscript
    document with mgv and possibly execute arbitrary code with the rights
    of the user running mgv.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    mgv is currently unmaintained, and the mgv website no longer exists. As
    such, the mgv package has been masked in Portage. We recommend that
    users select an alternate Postscript viewer such as ghostview or
    GSview, and unmerge mgv:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge "app-text/mgv"</code>
