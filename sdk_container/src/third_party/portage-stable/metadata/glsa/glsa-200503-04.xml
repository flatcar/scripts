    <p>
    NST discovered that, when submitting an announcement, uploaded files
    aren't correctly checked for malicious code. They also found out that
    phpWebSite is vulnerable to a path disclosure.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker can exploit this issue to upload files to a directory
    within the web root. By calling the uploaded script the attacker could
    then execute arbitrary PHP code with the rights of the web server. By
    passing specially crafted requests to the search module, remote
    attackers can also find out the full path of PHP scripts.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All phpWebSite users should upgrade to the latest available version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync 
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-apps/phpwebsite-0.10.0-r2"</code>
  </resolution>
