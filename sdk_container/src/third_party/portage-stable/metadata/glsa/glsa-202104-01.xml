  <background>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system designed.</p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>It was discovered that Git could be fooled into running remote code
      during a clone on case-insensitive file systems with support for symbolic
      links, if Git is configured globally to apply delay-capable clean/smudge
      filters (such as Git LFS).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to clone a specially crafted
      repository, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
      with the privileges of the user running the application.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Git users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-vcs/git-2.26.3"
    </code>
