    <p>
    A possible buffer overflow exists in the code processing MSN SLP messages
    (CAN-2004-0891). memcpy() was used without validating the size of the
    buffer, and an incorrect buffer was used as destination under certain
    circumstances. Additionally, memory allocation problems were found in the
    processing of MSN SLP messages and the receiving of files. These issues
    could lead Gaim to try to allocate more memory than available, resulting in
    the crash of the application.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could crash Gaim and possibly execute arbitrary code by
    exploiting the buffer overflow.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Gaim users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=net-im/gaim-1.0.2"
    # emerge "&gt;=net-im/gaim-1.0.2"</code>
  </resolution>
