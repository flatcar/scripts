  <description>
    <p>
    There are several unspecified bugs in the QImage class which may cause
    crashes or allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running the Qt
    application. These bugs affect the PNG, XPM, BMP, GIF and JPEG image
    types.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker may exploit these bugs by causing a user to open a
    carefully-constructed image file in any one of these formats. This may
    be accomplished through e-mail attachments (if the user uses KMail), or
    by simply placing a malformed image on a website and then convicing the
    user to load the site in a Qt-based browser (such as Konqueror).
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version of Qt.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Qt users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=x11-libs/qt-3.3.3"
    # emerge "&gt;=x11-libs/qt-3.3.3"</code>
