  <title>Netatalk: Insecure tempfile handling in etc2ps.sh</title>
  <synopsis>
    The etc2ps.sh script, included in the Netatalk package, is vulnerable to
    symlink attacks, potentially allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary
    files with the rights of the user running the utility.

    <p>
    Netatalk is a kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite,
    which allows Unix hosts to act as file, print, and time servers for Apple
    computers. It includes several script utilities, including etc2ps.sh.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    The etc2ps.sh script creates temporary files in world-writeable directories
    with predictable names.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
    directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
    etc2ps.sh is executed, this would result in the file being overwritten with
    the rights of the user running the utility, which could be the root user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Netatalk users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=net-fs/netatalk-1.6.4-r1"
    # emerge "&gt;=net-fs/netatalk-1.6.4-r1"</code>
