    <p>
    Neil Hoggarth has discovered that when delivering messages to a message
    delivery agent by means of the "mda" option, Fetchmail passes a NULL
    pointer to the ferror() and fflush() functions when refusing a message.
    Isaac Wilcox has discovered numerous means of plain-text password
    disclosure due to errors in secure connection establishment.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could deliver a message via Fetchmail to a message delivery
    agent configured to refuse the message, and crash the Fetchmail
    process. SMTP and LMTP delivery modes are not affected by this
    vulnerability. An attacker could also perform a Man-in-the-Middle
    attack, and obtain plain-text authentication credentials of users
    connecting to a Fetchmail process.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All fetchmail users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-mail/fetchmail-6.3.6"</code>
  </resolution>
