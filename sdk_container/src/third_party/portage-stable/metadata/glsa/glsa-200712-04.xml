    <p>
    Multiple integer overflows were reported, one of which Peter Valchev
    (Google Security) found to be leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
    in the cairo_image_surface_create_from_png() function that processes
    PNG images.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to view or process a specially
    crafted PNG image file in an application linked against Cairo, possibly
    leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    user running the application.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Cairo users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=x11-libs/cairo-1.4.12"</code>
