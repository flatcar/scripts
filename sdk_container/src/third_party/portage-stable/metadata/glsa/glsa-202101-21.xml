  <background>
    <p>Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework.</p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>A bug was discovered in the flatpak-portal service that can allow
      sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a
      sandbox escape).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
      Flatpak app possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
      privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the
      flatpak-portal service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent
      many Flatpak apps from working correctly. It is highly recommended to
      upgrade.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Flatpak users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=sys-apps/flatpak-1.10.0"
    </code>
