      CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code using specially
      crafted streams, IPP requests or files, or cause a Denial of Service
      (daemon crash or hang). A local attacker may be able to gain escalated
      privileges or overwrite arbitrary files. Furthermore, a remote attacker
      may be able to obtain sensitive information from the CUPS process or
      hijack a CUPS administrator authentication request.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-print/cups-1.4.8-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since September 03, 2011. It is likely that your system is
      already no longer affected by this issue.
