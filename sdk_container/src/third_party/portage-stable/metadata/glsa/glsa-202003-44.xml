  <affected>
    <package name="dev-util/bsdiff" auto="yes" arch="*">
      <unaffected range="ge">4.3-r4</unaffected>
      <vulnerable range="lt">4.3-r4</vulnerable>

  </affected>
  <background>
    <p>bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary
      files.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>It was discovered that the implementation of bspatch did not check for a
      negative value on numbers of bytes read from the diff and extra streams.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to apply a specially crafted patch
      using bspatch, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
      privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Binary diff users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-util/bsdiff-4.3-r4"
    </code>
