    <p>
    ClamAV is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration with mail
    servers to perform attachment scanning. ClamAV also provides a command
    line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the virus database.

    <p>
    ClamAV has multiple security flaws: a boundary check was performed
    incorrectly in petite.c, a buffer size calculation in unfsg_133 was
    incorrect in fsg.c, a possible infinite loop was fixed in tnef.c and a
    possible infinite loop in cabd_find was fixed in cabd.c . In addition
    to this, Marcin Owsiany reported that a corrupted DOC file causes a
    segmentation fault in ClamAV.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    By sending a malicious attachment to a mail server that is hooked with
    ClamAV, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service or the
    execution of arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-antivirus/clamav-0.87.1"</code>
  </resolution>
