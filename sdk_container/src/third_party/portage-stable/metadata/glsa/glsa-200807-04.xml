  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
    file with a Poppler-based PDF viewer such as Gentoo's Xpdf, Epdfview,
    or Evince, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
    with the privileges of the user running the application.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-text/poppler-0.6.3-r1"</code>
