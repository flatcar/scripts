  <synopsis>

    service, allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

  <affected>

      <vulnerable range="le">4.21.0-r2</vulnerable>

  <background>
    <p>
    Centericq is a text mode menu-driven and window-driven instant
    messaging interface.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    When interfacing with the LiveJournal service, Centericq does not
    appropriately allocate memory for incoming data, in some cases creating
    a buffer overflow.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could entice a user to connect to an unofficial LiveJournal
    server causing Centericq to read specially crafted data from the
    server, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the
    rights of the user running Centericq.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Currently, Centericq is unmaintained. As such, Centericq has been
    masked in Portage until it is again maintained.
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge "net-im/centericq"</code>
