  <background>
    <p>
    Monit is a system administration utility that allows management and
    monitoring of processes, files, directories and devices on a Unix
    system.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    A denial of service may occur due to Monit not sanitizing remotely
    supplied HTTP parameters before passing them to memory allocation
    functions. This could allow an attacker to cause an unexpected
    condition that could lead to the Monit daemon crashing.
    </p>
    <p>
    An overly long http request method may cause a buffer overflow due to
    Monit performing insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP
    requests.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker may crash the Monit daemon to create a denial of service
    condition or cause a buffer overflow that would allow arbitrary code to
    be executed with root privileges.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
    advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Monit users should upgrade to version 4.2 or later:
    </p>
    <code> 
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=app-admin/monit-4.2"
    # emerge "&gt;=app-admin/monit-4.2"</code>
  </resolution>
