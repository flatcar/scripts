    designed especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

    <p>
    Nikolaos Rangos discovered a vulnerability in ClamAV which exists
    because the recipient address extracted from email messages is not
    properly sanitized before being used in a call to "popen()" when
    executing sendmail (CVE-2007-4560). Also, NULL-pointer dereference
    errors exist within the "cli_scanrtf()" function in libclamav/rtf.c and
    Stefanos Stamatis discovered a NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability
    within the "cli_html_normalise()" function in libclamav/htmlnorm.c
    (CVE-2007-4510).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    The unsanitized recipient address can be exploited to execute arbitrary
    code with the privileges of the clamav-milter process by sending an
    email with a specially crafted recipient address to the affected
    system. Also, the NULL-pointer dereference errors can be exploited to
    crash ClamAV. Successful exploitation of the latter vulnerability
    requires that clamav-milter is started with the "black hole" mode
    activated, which is not enabled by default.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-antivirus/clamav-0.91.2"</code>
  </resolution>
