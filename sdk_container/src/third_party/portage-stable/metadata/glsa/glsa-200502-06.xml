    <p>
    Multiple vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, out of
    bounds memory access and directory traversals, have been discovered in
    libXpm, which is shipped as a part of the X Window System. LessTif, an
    application that includes libXpm, suffers from the same issues.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A carefully-crafted XPM file could crash applications making use
    of the LessTif toolkit, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary
    code with the privileges of the user running the application.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All LessTif users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=x11-libs/lesstif-0.94.0"</code>
  </resolution>
