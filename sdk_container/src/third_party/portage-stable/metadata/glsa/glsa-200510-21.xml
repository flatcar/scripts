    administration of MySQL over the web.

    Stefan Esser discovered that by calling certain PHP files directly, it
    was possible to workaround the grab_globals.lib.php security model and
    overwrite the $cfg configuration array. Systems running PHP in safe
    mode are not affected. Futhermore, Tobias Klein reported several
    cross-site-scripting issues resulting from insufficient user input
    sanitizing.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
    requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of
    the user running the web server. Furthermore, the cross-site scripting
    issues give a remote attacker the ability to inject and execute
    malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
    credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround for all those issues at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.6.4_p3"</code>
  </resolution>
