  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker, posing as a dyndns.org server, could execute
    arbitrary code with the rights of the user running dyndnsupdate.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Currently, there is no released version of dyndnsupdate that contains a
    fix for these issues. The original xzabite.org distribution site is
    dead, the code contains several other problems and more secure
    alternatives exist, such as the net-dns/ddclient package. Therefore,
    the dyndnsupdate package has been hard-masked prior to complete removal
    from Portage, and current users are advised to unmerge the package:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge net-misc/dyndnsupdate</code>
