    <p>
    Evgeny Legerov discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
    s_replace() function in support.c, as well as a buffer overflow in in
    the mod_tls module. Additionally, an off-by-two error related to the
    CommandBufferSize configuration directive was reported.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An authenticated attacker could exploit the s_replace() vulnerability
    by uploading a crafted .message file or sending specially crafted
    commands to the server, possibly resulting in the execution of
    arbitrary code with the rights of the user running ProFTPD. An
    unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted data to the
    server with mod_tls enabled which could result in the execution of
    arbitrary code with the rights of the user running ProFTPD. Finally,
    the off-by-two error related to the CommandBufferSize configuration
    directive was fixed - exploitability of this error is disputed. Note
    that the default configuration on Gentoo is to run ProFTPD as an
    unprivileged user, and has mod_tls disabled.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.0a"</code>
  </resolution>
