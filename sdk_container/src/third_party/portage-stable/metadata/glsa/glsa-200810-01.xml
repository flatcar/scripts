    Jukka Ruohonen initially reported a boundary error within the
    searchwn() function in src/wn.c. A thorough investigation by the oCERT
    team revealed several other vulnerabilities in WordNet:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Jukka Ruohonen and Rob Holland (oCERT) reported multiple boundary
    errors within the searchwn() function in src/wn.c, the wngrep()
    function in lib/search.c, the morphstr() and morphword() functions in
    lib/morph.c, and the getindex() in lib/search.c, which lead to
    stack-based buffer overflows.</li>
    <li>Rob Holland (oCERT) reported two
    boundary errors within the do_init() function in lib/morph.c, which
    lead to stack-based buffer overflows via specially crafted
    "WNSEARCHDIR" or "WNHOME" environment variables.</li>
    <li>Rob Holland
    (oCERT) reported multiple boundary errors in the bin_search() and
    bin_search_key() functions in binsrch.c, which lead to stack-based
    buffer overflows via specially crafted data files.</li>
    <li>Rob Holland
    (oCERT) reported a boundary error within the parse_index() function in
    lib/search.c, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow via specially
    crafted data files.</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <ul>
    <li>In case the application is accessible e.g. via a web server,
    a remote attacker could pass overly long strings as arguments to the
    "wm" binary, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.</li>
    <li>A local attacker could exploit the second vulnerability via
    specially crafted "WNSEARCHDIR" or "WNHOME" environment variables,
    possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with escalated
    privileges.</li>
    <li>A local attacker could exploit the third and
    fourth vulnerability by making the application use specially crafted
    data files, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.</li>
    </ul>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All WordNet users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-dicts/wordnet-3.0-r2"</code>
  </resolution>
