    cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL
    syntax, supporting numerous protocols.

    <p>
    Stefan Esser from the Hardened-PHP Project has reported a
    vulnerability in cURL that allows for a local buffer overflow when cURL
    attempts to parse specially crafted URLs. The URL can be specially
    crafted in one of two ways: the URL could be malformed in a way that
    prevents a terminating null byte from being added to either a hostname
    or path buffer; or the URL could contain a "?" separator in the
    hostname portion, which causes a "/" to be prepended to the resulting
    string.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    An attacker capable of getting cURL to parse a maliciously crafted
    URL could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user making the call to cURL. An attacker could also
    escape open_basedir or safe_mode pseudo-restrictions when exploiting
    this problem from within a PHP program when PHP is compiled with
    libcurl.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-misc/curl-7.15.1"</code>
  </resolution>
