  <description>
    <p>
    The pdnsd team has discovered an unspecified buffer overflow
    vulnerability. The PROTOS DNS Test Suite, by the Oulu University Secure
    Programming Group (OUSPG), has also revealed a memory leak error within
    the handling of the QTYPE and QCLASS DNS queries, leading to
    consumption of large amounts of memory.

  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker can craft malicious DNS queries leading to a Denial of
    Service, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All pdnsd users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-dns/pdnsd-1.2.4-r1"</code>
  </resolution>
