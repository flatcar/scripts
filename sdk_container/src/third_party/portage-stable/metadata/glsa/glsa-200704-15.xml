  <title>MadWifi: Multiple vulnerabilities</title>
  <synopsis>
    Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MadWifi driver,
    possibly leading to a Denial of Service and information disclosure.

  <background>
    <p>
    The MadWifi driver provides support for Atheros based IEEE 802.11
    Wireless Lan cards.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    The driver does not properly process Channel Switch Announcement
    Information Elements, allowing for an abnormal channel change. The
    ieee80211_input() function does not properly handle AUTH frames and the
    driver sends unencrypted packets before WPA authentication succeeds.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could send specially crafted AUTH frames to the
    vulnerable host, resulting in a Denial of Service by crashing the
    kernel. A remote attacker could gain access to sensitive information
    about network architecture by sniffing unencrypted packets. A remote
    attacker could also send a Channel Switch Count less than or equal to
    one to trigger a channel change, resulting in a communication loss and
    a Denial of Service.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All MadWifi users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-wireless/madwifi-ng-0.9.3"</code>
  </resolution>
