GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.
See LGPL-3 for the full text of this license.

As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you
may link, statically or dynamically, a "work that uses the Library"
with a publicly distributed version of the Library to produce an
executable file containing portions of the Library, and distribute
that executable file under terms of your choice, without any of the
additional requirements listed in clause 6 of the GNU Library General
Public License.  By "a publicly distributed version of the Library",
we mean either the unmodified Library as distributed by the copyright
holder, or a modified version of the Library that is distributed under
the conditions defined in clause 3 of the GNU Library General Public
License.  This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons
why the executable file might be covered by the GNU Lesser General
Public License.
