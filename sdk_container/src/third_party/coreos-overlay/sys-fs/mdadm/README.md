This is a fork of Gentoo's sys-fs/mdadm package. The main reason of
having this fork is to carry two patches that are already a part of
upstream, but the release didn't yet happen, and Gentoo does not carry
them either.

There is also a minor change to build this package by default for
arm64 without needing an entry in accept_keywords file.
