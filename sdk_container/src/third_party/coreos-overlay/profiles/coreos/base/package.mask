# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# Python 3.12 is in portage-stable (currently testing), so avoid picking it
# up. Update this to mask later versions when we switch to 3.11.
>=dev-lang/python-3.12

# Update engine needs updating to use a newer version of protobuf.
>=dev-libs/protobuf-22.0

# Pulls in LLVM and clang.
>=sys-block/thin-provisioning-tools-1.0.14

# Too large to fit into our /boot partition - the size grew by 3MB. We
# mask a specific version in hope that the future update may be smaller,
# who knows.

# Make sure that we stay on version 3.4.x for OpenSSL on this branch
# even if `::portage-stable` holds more recent version (3.5.x)
