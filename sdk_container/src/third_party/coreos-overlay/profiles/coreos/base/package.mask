# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# Overwrite portage-stable mask. We are delaying the transition to
# libxcrypt, because we need to figure out how to solve the dep loop
# that results from the migration (python -> virtual/libcrypt ->
# libxcrypt -> glibc -> python).
>=virtual/libcrypt-2

# Python 3.12 is in portage-stable (currently testing), so avoid picking it
# up. Update this to mask later versions when we switch to 3.11.
>=dev-lang/python-3.12
