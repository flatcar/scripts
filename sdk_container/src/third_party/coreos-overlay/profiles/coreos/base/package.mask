# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.

# don't work when building for the board root directories.
