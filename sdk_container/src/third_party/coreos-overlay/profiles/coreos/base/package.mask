# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# Python 3.12 is in portage-stable (currently testing), so avoid picking it
# up. Update this to mask later versions when we switch to 3.11.
>=dev-lang/python-3.12

# From this version, the lib creates some issues
# with Secure Boot signing image using Azure libpkcs11:
#  dataFinal failed
