# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# Update engine needs updating to use a newer version of protobuf.
>=dev-libs/protobuf-22.0

# Do not install python versions that were "disabled" in
# PYTHON_TARGETS. For some reason emerge still insists on installing
# those as a dependency for some packages.
<dev-lang/python-3.12
>=dev-lang/python-3.13
