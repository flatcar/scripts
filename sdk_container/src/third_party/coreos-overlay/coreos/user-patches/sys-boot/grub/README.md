Flatcar uses a patched version of the GRUB, which implements the functionality to
read the [Flatcar Container Linux partition table](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/reference/developer-guides/sdk-disk-partitions/#partition-table).

## History

CoreOS Container Linux maintained a fork of the [grub](https://github.com/coreos/grub) and then was referenced
in the coreos-overlay. Any changes were made through [PRs](https://github.com/coreos/grub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to the grub repository.

When Flatcar was born, a `grub` repo under the flatcar-linux org was created
and referenced in the Flatcar's coreos-overlay. Except for a few, now many changes
where brought into the system.

The repo was maintained at 2.02 version. During the 2.06 migration, the philosophy
to use a separate repo was scrapped, and two patch files were created. The patch
files migrated only the essential commits, and dropped all the other commits, which
were either half-baked, or redundant at the point of migration.

From version 2.12, Flatcar has adopted Red Hat's large patch set. This fixes
Secure Boot on arm64 and the TPM Event Log on amd64, among many other things.

A further two patches are applied on top. One is for additional GPT
functionality, and the other is for extracting the verity root hash from the
initrd. Gentoo's upstream ebuild is used, but Gentoo's patches are discarded
because they conflict and are not relevant to Flatcar.

## How to import the Red Hat patches

Red Hat maintains a fork of GRUB on GitHub with branches for each Fedora release. Generate a diff between the latest upstream release and the latest Fedora branch.

```
git clone https://github.com/rhboot/grub2.git grub
cd grub
git diff grub-<VERSION>..fedora-<VERSION> -- . ':(exclude).gitignore' ':(exclude)bootstrap.conf' > grub-2.12-00-redhat.patch
```

## Summary of the Flatcar patches

The patch starts with adding a new implementation of reading the GPT instead
of using the traditional module. It provides essential functionality to interact
with GPT structures on disk, and checking/validating data integrity & GPT specification.

The commits goes on to add the following modules gptprio, gptrepair, and search
commands by label and partition.

The `gptprio` command which provides a mechanism to prioritize and select the
next bootable partition based on the GPT attributes and results in flexible
partition booting. The `gptrepair` command implements the repair functions for
GPT information on a specified device. Few other functions include searching
devices by partition label or partition UUID.

commit f69a9e0fdcf63ac33906e2753e14152bab2fcd05
Author: Michael Marineau <michael.marineau@coreos.com>
Date:   Sun Sep 28 21:26:21 2014 -0700

    gpt: start new GPT module

    This module is a new implementation for reading GUID Partition Tables
    which is much stricter than the existing part_gpt module and exports GPT
    data directly instead of the generic grub_partition structure. It will
    be the basis for modules that need to read/write/update GPT data.

    The current code does nothing more than read and verify the table.

    gpt: rename misnamed header location fields

    The header location fields refer to 'this header' and 'alternate header'
    respectively, not 'primary header' and 'backup header'. The previous
    field names are backwards for the backup header.

commit 94f04a532d2b0e2b81e47a92488ebb1613bda1a0

    gpt: record size of of the entries table

    The size of the entries table will be needed later when writing it back
    to disk. Restructure the entries reading code to flow a little better.

Date:   Sat Oct 18 18:18:17 2014 -0700

    gpt: consolidate crc32 computation code

    The gcrypt API is overly verbose, wrap it up in a helper function to
    keep this rather common operation easy to use.

    gpt: add new repair function to sync up primary and backup tables.

commit 5e1829d4141343617b5e13e84298d118eac15bdf
Author: Michael Marineau <michael.marineau@coreos.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 19 14:21:29 2014 -0700

    gpt: add write function and gptrepair command

    The first hint of something practical, a command that can restore any of
    the GPT structures from the alternate location. New test case must run
    under QEMU because the loopback device used by the other unit tests does
    not support writing.

commit 2cd009dffe98c19672394608661767e4c3c84764
Author: Michael Marineau <michael.marineau@coreos.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 30 20:55:21 2014 -0700

    gpt: add a new generic GUID type

    In order to do anything with partition GUIDs they need to be stored in a
    proper structure like the partition type GUIDs. Additionally add an
    initializer macro to simplify defining both GUID types.

    gpt: new gptprio.next command for selecting priority based partitions

    Basic usage would look something like this:

        gptprio.next -d usr_dev -u usr_uuid
        linuxefi ($usr_dev)/boot/vmlinuz mount.usr=PARTUUID=$usr_uuid

    After booting the system should set the 'successful' bit on the
    partition that was used.

    In UEFI/GPT strings are UTF-16 so use a uint16 to make dealing with the
    string practical.

    gpt: do not use disk sizes GRUB will reject as invalid later on

    GRUB assumes that no disk is ever larger than 1EiB and rejects
    reads/writes to such locations. Unfortunately this is not conveyed in
    the usual way with the special GRUB_DISK_SIZE_UNKNOWN value.

    gpt: properly detect and repair invalid tables

    GPT_BOTH_VALID is 4 bits so simple a boolean check is not sufficient.
    This broken condition allowed gptprio to trust bogus disk locations in
    headers that were marked invalid causing arbitrary disk corruption.

    gpt: fix partition table indexing and validation

    Portions of the code attempted to handle the fact that GPT entries on
    disk may be larger than the currently defined struct while others
    assumed the data could be indexed by the struct size directly. This
    never came up because no utility uses a size larger than 128 bytes but
    for the sake of safety we need to do this by the spec.

    gpt: prefer disk size from header over firmware

    The firmware and the OS may disagree on the disk configuration and size.
    Although such a setup should be avoided users are unlikely to know about
    the problem, assuming everything behaves like the OS. Tolerate this as
    best we can and trust the reported on-disk location over the firmware
    when looking for the backup GPT. If the location is inaccessible report
    the error as best we can and move on.

    gpt: check header and entries status bits together

    Use the new status function which checks *_HEADER_VALID and
    *_ENTRIES_VALID bits together. It doesn't make sense for the header and
    entries bits to mismatch so don't allow for it.

    gpt: be more careful about relocating backup header

    The header was being relocated without checking the new location is
    actually safe. If the BIOS thinks the disk is smaller than the OS then
    repair may relocate the header into allocated space, failing the final
    validation check. So only move it if the disk has grown.

    Additionally, if the backup is valid then we can assume its current
    location is good enough and leave it as-is.

    gpt: read entries table at the same time as the header

    I personally think this reads easier. Also has the side effect of
    directly comparing the primary and backup tables instead of presuming
    they are equal if the crc32 matches.

    gpt: rename and update documentation for grub_gpt_update

    The function now does more than just recompute checksums so give it a
    more general name to reflect that.

    gpt: write backup GPT first, skip if inaccessible.

    Writing the primary GPT before the backup may lead to a confusing
    situation: booting a freshly updated system could consistently fail and
    next boot will fall back to the old system if writing the primary works
    but writing the backup fails. If the backup is written first and fails
    the primary is left in the old state so the next boot will re-try and
    possibly fail in the exact same way. Making that repeatable should make
    it easier for users to identify the error.

    Additionally if the firmware and OS disagree on the disk size, making
    the backup inaccessible to GRUB, then just skip writing the backup.
    When this happens the automatic call to `coreos-setgoodroot` after boot
    will take care of repairing the backup.
