The `0001-Reorganize-the-login-sessions.patch` is something we could
try to upstream if it is proven to work.

The `0002-Flatcar-modifications.patch` is just some Flatcar-specific
changes. Not sure if all them are necessary, but it is trying to
more-or-less match the config files from old baselayout.
