The patches `0001-Fix-sssd-login.patch` and
`0002-Reorganize-the-login-sessions.patch` are something we could try
to upstream if it is proven to work.

The `0003-Flatcar-modifications.patch` is just some Flatcar-specific
changes. Not sure if all them are necessary, but it is trying to
more-or-less match the config files from old baselayout.
