# sys-apps/policycoreutils creates /var/lib/selinux directory in
# src_install and then needs it to be available when running
# pkg_postinst, because it does a policy module rebuild there. We
# initially have put /var/lib/selinux into INSTALL_MASK and told
# coreos-base/misc-files to install the directory at
# /usr/lib/selinux/policy together with a symlink at /var/lib/selinux
# pointing to the directory. But this is done too late - at
# sys-apps/policycoreutils' pkg_postinst time, /var/lib/selinux does
# not exist, because coreos-base/misc-files was not yet emerged. So we
# need to fall back to this hack, where we set up /var/lib/selinux and
# /usr/lib/selinux/policy the way we want.
