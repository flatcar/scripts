# The pkg_postinst phase function wants to generate an rndc.key file

# at all as it's presumably for named. Also, we masked the installtion
# of the script. Thus we fool the phase function by putting an empty
# key file there, so the function won't trigger the generation. We
# drop the key file later too.
