 * [Microsoft Azure Stack] (`azurestack`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the custom data provided to the instance. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * Bare Metal - Use the `ignition.config.url` kernel parameter to provide a URL to the configuration. The URL can use the `http://`, `https://`, `tftp://`, `s3://`, or `gs://` schemes to specify a remote config or the `oem://` scheme to specify a local config, rooted in `/usr/share/oem`.
 * [Brightbox] (`brightbox`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
+* `cloudsigma` - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [CloudStack] (`cloudstack`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata via either metadata service or config drive. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [DigitalOcean] (`digitalocean`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the droplet userdata. Cloud SSH keys and network configuration are handled separately.
 * [Exoscale] (`exoscale`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [Google Cloud] (`gcp`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance metadata entry named "user-data". Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
+* `hyperv` - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [IBM Cloud] (`ibmcloud`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [KubeVirt] (`kubevirt`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata via config drive. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * Bare Metal (`metal`) - Use the `ignition.config.url` kernel parameter to provide a URL to the configuration. The URL can use the `http://`, `https://`, `tftp://`, `s3://`, `arn:`, or `gs://` schemes to specify a remote config.
+* `niftycloud` - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [Nutanix] (`nutanix`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata via config drive. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [OpenStack] (`openstack`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata via either metadata service or config drive. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [Equinix Metal] (`packet`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [IBM Power Systems Virtual Server] (`powervs`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [QEMU] (`qemu`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the 'opt/com.coreos/config' key on the QEMU Firmware Configuration Device (available in QEMU 2.4.0 and higher).
+* `rackspace` - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
+* `rackspace-onmetal` - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
+* `vagrant` - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
 * [VirtualBox] (`virtualbox`) - Use the VirtualBox guest property `/Ignition/Config` to provide the config to the virtual machine.
 * [VMware] (`vmware`) - Use the VMware Guestinfo variables `ignition.config.data` and `ignition.config.data.encoding` to provide the config and its encoding to the virtual machine. Valid encodings are "", "base64", and "gzip+base64". Guestinfo variables can be provided directly or via an OVF environment, with priority given to variables specified directly.
 * [Vultr] (`vultr`) - Ignition will read its configuration from the instance userdata. Cloud SSH keys are handled separately.
