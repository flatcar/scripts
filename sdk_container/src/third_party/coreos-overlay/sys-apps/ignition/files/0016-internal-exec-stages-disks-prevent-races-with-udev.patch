Subject: [PATCH 16/18] internal/exec/stages/disks: prevent races with udev

The "udevadm settle" command used to wait for udev to process the disk
changes and recreate the entries under /dev was still prone to races
where udev didn't get notified yet of the final event to wait for.
This caused the boot with a btrfs root filesystem created by Ignition
to fail almost every time on certain hardware.

Issue tagged events and wait for them to be processed by udev. This is
actually meanigful in all stages not only for the other parts of the
initramfs which may be surprised by sudden device nodes disappearing
shortly like the case was with systemd's fsck service but also for the
inter-stage dependencies which currently are using the waiter for
systemd device units but that doesn't really prevent from races with
udev device node recreation. Thus, these changes are complementary to
the existing waiter which mainly has the purpose to wait for unmodified
devices. For newly created RAIDs we can wait for the new node to be
available as udev will not recreate it.
Note: This is a port for Ignition 0.35 while for 2.2 this also should
be done for LUKS.
