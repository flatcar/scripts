# packages_build() should be called w/ the positional INPUT parameters below.

# OS image binary packages build automation stub.
#   This script will use an SDK container to build packages for an OS image.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
#   1. SDK version and OS image version are recorded in sdk_container/.repo/manifests/version.txt
#   2. Scripts repo version tag of OS image version to be built is available and checked out.
#   3. SDK container is either
#       - available via ghcr.io/flatcar/flatcar-sdk-[ARCH]:[VERSION] (official SDK release)
#       OR
#       - available via build cache server "/containers/[VERSION]/flatcar-sdk-[ARCH]-[VERSION].tar.gz"
#         (dev SDK)
#
# INPUT:
#
#   1. Architecture (ARCH) of the TARGET OS image ("arm64", "amd64").
#
#
# OPTIONAL INPUT:
#
#   2. SIGNER. Environment variable. Name of the owner of the artifact signing key.
#        Defaults to nothing if not set - in such case, artifacts will not be signed.
#        If provided, SIGNING_KEY environment variable should also be provided, otherwise this environment variable will be ignored.
#
#   3. SIGNING_KEY. Environment variable. The artifact signing key.
#        Defaults to nothing if not set - in such case, artifacts will not be signed.
#        If provided, SIGNER environment variable should also be provided, otherwise this environment variable will be ignored.
#
#   4. A file ../scripts.patch to apply with "git am -3" for the scripts repo.
#
# OUTPUT:
#
#   1. Exported container image "flatcar-packages-[ARCH]-[VERSION].tar.gz" with binary packages
#       pushed to buildcache, and torcx_manifest.json pushed to "images/${arch}/${vernum}/"
#       (for use with tests).
#   2. "./ci-cleanup.sh" with commands to clean up temporary build resources,
#        to be run after this step finishes / when this step is aborted.
#   3. If signer key was passed, signatures of artifacts from point 1, pushed along to buildcache.
#   4. DIGESTS of the artifacts from point 1, pushed to buildcache. If signer key was passed, armored ASCII files of the generated DIGESTS files too, pushed to buildcache.
