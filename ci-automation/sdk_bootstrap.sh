# sdk_bootstrap() should be called w/ the positional INPUT parameters below.

# Bootstrap SDK build automation stub.
#  This script will use a seed SDK container + tarball to bootstrap a 
#   new SDK tarball.
#
# INPUT:
#
#   1. Version of the SEED SDK to use (string).
#       The seed SDK tarball must be available on https://mirror.release.flatcar-linux.net/sdk/ ...
#       The seed SDK container must be available from https://github.com/orgs/flatcar/packages
#          (via ghcr.io/flatcar/flatcar-sdk-all:[VERSION]).
#
#   2. Version of the TARGET SDK to build (string).
#       The version pattern 'MMMM.m.p' (e.g. '3051.0.0') denotes a "official" build, i.e. a release build to be published.
#       Use any version diverging from the pattern (e.g. '3051.0.0-nightly-4302') for development / CI builds.
#       A free-standing tagged commit will be created in the scripts repo and pushed upstream.
#
# OPTIONAL INPUT:
#
#   3. ARCH. Environment variable. Target architecture for the SDK to run on.
#        Either "amd64" or "arm64"; defaults to "amd64" if not set.
#
#   4. SIGNER. Environment variable. Name of the owner of the artifact signing key.
#        Defaults to nothing if not set - in such case, artifacts will not be signed.
#        If provided, SIGNING_KEY environment variable should also be provided, otherwise this environment variable will be ignored.
#
#   5. SIGNING_KEY. Environment variable. The artifact signing key.
#        Defaults to nothing if not set - in such case, artifacts will not be signed.
#        If provided, SIGNER environment variable should also be provided, otherwise this environment variable will be ignored.
#
#   6. A file ../scripts.patch to apply with "git am -3" for the scripts repo.
#
#   7. AVOID_NIGHTLY_BUILD_SHORTCUTS. Environment variable. Tells the script to build the SDK even if nothing has changed since last nightly build.
#        See the description in ci-config.env.
#
# OUTPUT:
#
#   1. SDK tarball (gentoo catalyst output) of the new SDK, pushed to buildcache.
#   2. Updated scripts repository
#        - version tag
#        - manifests/version.txt denotes new SDK version
#   3. "./ci-cleanup.sh" with commands to clean up temporary build resources,
#        to be run after this step finishes / when this step is aborted.
#   4. If signer key was passed, signatures of artifacts from point 1, pushed along to buildcache.
#   5. DIGESTS of the artifacts from point 1, pushed to buildcache. If signer key was passed, armored ASCII files of the generated DIGESTS files too, pushed to buildcache.
