- Dropped Ciphers, MACs, and KexAlgorithms from the sshd configuration so that the OpenSSH upstream defaults are used. This introduces post-quantum key exchange algorithms for better security. ([Flatcar#1921](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/1921)). Users requiring legacy Ciphers, MACs, and/or KexAlgos can override / re-enable this by deploying a custom drop-in config  to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`.
