# This uses Gentoo's catalyst for very thoroughly building images from
# scratch. Using images based on this will eliminate some of the hackery
# in make_chroot.sh for building up the sdk from a stock stage3 tarball.
# 
# For reference the procedure it performs is this:
# 
# 1. snapshot: Grab a snapshot of the portage-stable repo from
#     the current SDK's /var/lib/gentoo/repos/gentoo.
#     Alternatively, check out a git ref specified via --portage-ref.
#
# 2. stage1: Using a "seed" tarball as a build environment, build a
#     minimal root file system into a clean directory using ROOT=...
#     and USE=-* The restricted USE flags are key be small and avoid
#     circular dependencies.
#     This stage uses:
#     - portage-stable from the SDK's /var/lib/gentoo/repos/gentoo
#        or a custom path via --stage1_portage_path command line option
#     - coreos-overlay  from the SDK's /var/lib/gentoo/repos/coreos-overlay
#        or a custom path via --stage1_overlay_path command line option
#     Command line option refs need caution though, since
#     stage1 must not contain updated ebuilds (see build_stage1 below).
#
# 3. stage2: Run portage-stable/scripts/bootstrap.sh
#     This rebuilds the toolchain using Gentoo bootstrapping, ensuring it's not linked
#     to or otherwise influenced by whatever was in the "seed" tarball.
#     The toolchain rebuild may contain updated package ebuilds from
#     third_party/(portage-stable|coreos-overlay).
#     This and all following stages use portage-stable and coreos-overlay
#     from third_party/... (see 1.)
#
# 4. stage3: Run emerge -e system to rebuild everything using the fresh updated
#     toolchain from 3., using the normal USE flags provided by the profile. This
#     will also pull in assorted base system packages that weren't included
#     in the minimal environment stage1 created.
#
# 5. stage4: Install any extra packages or other desired tweaks. For the
#     sdk we just install all the packages normally make_chroot.sh does.
#
# Usage: bootstrap_sdk [stage1 stage2 etc]
# By default all four stages will be built using the latest stage4 as a seed.

# Stage 1 uses "known-good" ebuilds (from both coreos-overlay and portage-stable)
#  to build a minimal toolchain (USE="-*") for stage 2.
#
# No package updates must happen in stage 1, so we use the portage-stable and
#  coreos-overlay paths included with the current SDK (from the SDK chroot's
#  /var/lib/gentoo/repos/). "Current SDK" refers to the SDK we entered with
#  'cork enter', i.e. the SDK we run ./bootstrap_sdk in.
#
# Using ebuilds from the above mentioned sources will ensure that stage 1 builds
#  a minimal stage 2 from known-good ebuild versions - the same ebuild versions
#  that were used to build the very SDK we run ./bootstrap_sdk in.
#
# DANGER ZONE
#
# Stage 1 lacks proper isolation and will link all packages built for
#  stage 2 against its own seed libraries ("/" in the catalyst chroot) instead of against libraries
#  installed into the FS root of the stage 2 seed ("/tmp/stage1root" in the catalyst chroot).
#  This is why we must prevent any updated package ebuilds to "leak" into stage 1, hence we use
#  "known good" ebuild repo versions outlined above.
#
# In special circumstances it may be required to circumvent this and use custom paths
#  for either (or both) portage and overlay. The command line options
#  --stage1-portage-path and --stage1-overlay-path may be used to specify
#  a repo path known to work for stage1. In that case the stage1 seed (i.e. the seed SDK)
#  will be updated prior to starting to build stage 2.
#  NOTE that this should never be used to introduce library updates in stage 1. All binaries
#  produced in stage 1 are linked against libraries in the seed tarball, NOT libraries produced
#  by stage one. Therefore, these binaries will cease to work in stage 2 when linked against
#  outdated "seed tarball" libraries which have been updated to newer versions in stage 1.
