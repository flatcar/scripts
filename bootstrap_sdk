# This uses Gentoo's catalyst for very thoroughly building images from scratch.
# For reference the procedure it performs is this:
#
# 1. seed: Take a recent SDK, dev container, or custom tarball as a seed to
#     build stage 1 with. Before proceeding, update relevant packages that have
#     changed sub-slot to avoid missing library issues later in the build.
#
# 2. stage1: Using the above seed tarball as a build environment, build a
#     minimal root file system into a clean directory using ROOT=... and USE=-*
#     The restricted USE flags are key be small and avoid circular dependencies.
#     NOTE that stage1 LACKS PROPER STAGE ISOLATION. Binaries produced in stage1
#     will be linked against the SEED SDK libraries, NOT against libraries built
#     in stage 1.
#
# 3. stage2: This is skipped as recommended by upstream Gentoo.
#
# 4. stage3: Run emerge -e system to rebuild everything using the normal USE
#     flags provided by the profile. This will also pull in assorted base system
#     packages that weren't included in the minimal environment stage1 created.
#
# 5. stage4: Install any extra packages or other desired tweaks. For the
#     sdk we just install all the packages normally make_chroot.sh does.
#
# Usage: bootstrap_sdk [stage1 stage3 etc]
# By default all four stages will be built using the latest stage4 as a seed.
