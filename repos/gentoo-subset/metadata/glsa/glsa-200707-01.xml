  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a specially crafted
    request to a vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the execution of
    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firebird.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Firebird users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-db/firebird-2.0.1"</code>
