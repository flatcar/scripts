  <title>tiff: New overflows in image decoding</title>
  <synopsis>
    An integer overflow has been found in the TIFF library image decoding
    routines and the tiffdump utility, potentially allowing arbitrary code
    execution.

    <p>
    The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the
    Tag Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including
    GNOME and KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

    infamous41md found a potential integer overflow in the directory
    entry count routines of the TIFF library (CAN-2004-1308). Dmitry V.
    Levin found another similar issue in the tiffdump utility
    (CAN-2004-1183).

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully crafted
    TIFF image file, which would potentially lead to execution of arbitrary
    code with the rights of the user viewing the image. This affects any
    program that makes use of the TIFF library, including many web browsers
    or mail readers.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All TIFF library users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/tiff-3.7.1-r1"</code>
  </resolution>
