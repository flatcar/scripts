        <p>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker.

It creates a database from the regular expression rules that it finds from the config file(s). Once this database is initialized it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several message digest algorithms (see below) that are used to check the integrity of the file. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked for inconsistencies.</p>
