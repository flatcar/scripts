    <p>rssh is a restricted shell, allowing only a few commands like scp or
      sftp. It is often used as a complement to OpenSSH to provide limited
      access to users.

  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>Gentoo has discontinued support for rssh. We recommend that users
      unmerge rssh:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --unmerge "app-shells/rssh"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: The Gentoo developer(s) maintaining rssh have discontinued support
      at this time. It may be possible that a new Gentoo developer will update
      rssh at a later date. OpenSSH (net-misc/openssh) may be able to provide
      similar functionality using its extensive configuration.
    </p>
