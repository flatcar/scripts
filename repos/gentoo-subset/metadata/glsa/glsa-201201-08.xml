  <description>
    <p>FontForge is vulnerable to an error when processing the
      "CHARSET_REGISTRY" header in font files, which could cause a stack-based
      buffer overflow.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted BDF
      file using FontForge font editor, possibly resulting in the remote
      execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the FontForge process,
      or a Denial of Service (application crash).
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All FontForge users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-gfx/fontforge-20110222-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since October 12, 2011. It is likely that your system is
      already no longer affected by this issue.
