    <p>
    Tomas Hoger reported that the _gdGetColors() function in gd_gd.c does
    not properly verify the colorsTotal struct member, possibly leading to
    a buffer overflow.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image
    file with a program using the GD library, possibly resulting in the
    remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
    running the application, or a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All GD users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/gd-2.0.35-r1"</code>
    <p>
    NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
    available since November 21, 2009. It is likely that your system is
    already no longer affected by this issue.
