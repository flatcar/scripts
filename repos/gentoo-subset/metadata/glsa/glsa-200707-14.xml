    <p>
    mu-b from Digital Labs discovered that the return value of a snprintf()
    call is not properly checked before being used. This could lead to an
    integer overflow.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could send specially crafted BGP packets on a network
    being monitored with tcpdump, possibly resulting in the execution of
    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running tcpdump, which
    is usually root.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All tcpdump users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-analyzer/tcpdump-3.9.5-r3"</code>
