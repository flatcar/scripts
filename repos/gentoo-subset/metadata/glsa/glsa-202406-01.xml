        <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in GLib. Please review the CVE identifier referenced below for details.</p>
    </description>
    <impact type="high">
        <p>When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from a trusted system service such as NetworkManager or logind on a shared computer, other users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that the GDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by the trusted system service. This could lead to the GDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.</p>
    </impact>
    <workaround>
        <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
    </workaround>
    <resolution>
        <p>All GLib users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
        
        <code>
          # emerge --sync
          # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/glib-2.78.6"
        </code>
