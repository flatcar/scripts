  <synopsis>

    PDFKit is a framework for rendering of PDF content in GNUstep
    applications. ImageKits is a collection of frameworks to support
    imaging in GNUstep applications.

    <p>
    Maurycy Prodeus discovered an integer overflow vulnerability possibly
    leading to a stack-based buffer overflow in the XPDF code which PDFKit
    is based on. ImageKits also contains a copy of PDFKit.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By enticing a user to view a specially crafted PDF file with a viewer
    based on ImageKits or PDFKit such as Gentoo's ViewPDF, a remote
    attacker could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the
    execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
    application.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    PDFKit and ImageKits are not maintained upstream, so the packages were
    masked in Portage. We recommend that users unmerge PDFKit and
    ImageKits:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge gnustep-libs/pdfkit
    # emerge --unmerge gnustep-libs/imagekits</code>
    <p>
    As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use PopplerKit
    instead of PDFKit and Vindaloo instead of ViewPDF.
    </p>
