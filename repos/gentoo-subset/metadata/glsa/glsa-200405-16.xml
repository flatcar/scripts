    <p>
    SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
    SMTP, and can optionally be installed with SQL support.

  <description>
    <p>
    Several unspecified cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and a
    well hidden SQL injection vulnerability were found. An XSS attack
    allows an attacker to insert malicious code into a web-based
    application. SquirrelMail does not check for code when parsing
    variables received via the URL query string.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    One of the XSS vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker to
    steal cookie-based authentication credentials from the user's browser.
    The SQL injection issue could potentially be used by an attacker to run
    arbitrary SQL commands inside the SquirrelMail database with privileges
    of the SquirrelMail database user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to
    upgrade to version 1.4.3_rc1 or higher of SquirrelMail.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3_rc1"
    # emerge "&gt;=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3_rc1"</code>
  </resolution>
