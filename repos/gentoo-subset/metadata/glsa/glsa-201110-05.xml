  <impact type="normal">
    <p>An attacker could perform man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof arbitrary
      SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
      Certification Authority or to inject an arbitrary amount of chosen
      plaintext into the beginning of the application protocol stream, allowing
      for further exploitation.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All GnuTLS users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-libs/gnutls-2.10.0"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since August 6, 2010. It is likely that your system is already
      no longer affected by this issue.
