  <background>
    <p>TCPTrack is a simple libpcap based program for live TCP connection
      monitoring.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in TCPTrack’s
      parsing of command line arguments. This is only a vulnerability in
      limited scenarios in which TCPTrack is “configured as a handler for
      other applications.”
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
      privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition with a
      specially crafted command-line argument.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All TCPTrack users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-analyzer/tcptrack-1.4.2"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since August 06, 2011. It is likely that your system is already
      no longer affected by this issue.
