  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-client/seamonkey-2.53.5.1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Gentoo has discontinued support for the SeaMonkey binary package. We
      recommend that users unmerge the SeaMonkey binary package:
    </p>
    
    <p># emerge --unmerge “www-client/seamonkey-bin”</p>
    
    <p>NOTE: The Gentoo developer(s) maintaining the SeaMonkey binary package
      have discontinued support at this time. It may be possible that a new
      Gentoo developer will update it at a later date. The alternative is using
      the standard SeaMonkey package.
    </p>
