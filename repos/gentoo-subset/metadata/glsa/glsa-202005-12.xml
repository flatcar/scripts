  <resolution>
    <p>Gentoo has discontinued support for OpenSLP. We recommend that users
      unmerge OpenSLP:
      <code>
        # emerge --unmerge "net-libs/openslp"
      </code>
      
      <p>NOTE: The Gentoo developer(s) maintaining OpenSLP have discontinued
        support at this time. It may be possible that a new Gentoo developer
        will update OpenSLP at a later date. No known alternatives to OpenSLP
        are in the tree at this time.
