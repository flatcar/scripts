    </description>
    <impact type="normal">
        <p>A flaw was found in the way nettle&#39;s RSA decryption functions handled specially crafted ciphertext. An attacker could use this flaw to provide a manipulated ciphertext leading to application crash and denial of service.</p>
    </impact>
    <workaround>
        <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
    </workaround>
