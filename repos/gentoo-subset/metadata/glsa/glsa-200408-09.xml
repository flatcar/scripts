    web, and e-mail interfaces.

  <description>
    <p>
    Improper handling of a specially crafted URL allows access to the
    server's filesystem, which could contain sensitive information.
    </p>

  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    An attacker could view files owned by the user running Roundup. This
    will never be root however, as Roundup will not run as root.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version of Roundup.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Roundup users should upgrade to the latest version:

    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=www-apps/roundup-0.7.6"
