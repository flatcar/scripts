  <background>
    <p>
    Dnsmasq is a lightweight and easily-configurable DNS forwarder and
    DHCP server.

  <description>
    <p>
    Dnsmasq does not properly detect that DNS replies received do not
    correspond to any DNS query that was sent. Rob Holland of the Gentoo
    Linux Security Audit team also discovered two off-by-one buffer
    overflows that could crash DHCP lease files parsing.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could send malicious answers to insert arbitrary
    DNS data into the Dnsmasq cache. These attacks would in turn help an
    attacker to perform man-in-the-middle and site impersonation attacks.
    The buffer overflows might allow an attacker on the local network to
    crash Dnsmasq upon restart.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Dnsmasq users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-dns/dnsmasq-2.22"</code>
  </resolution>
