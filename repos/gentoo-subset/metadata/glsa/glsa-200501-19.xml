    <p>
    imlib2 is an advanced replacement for image manipulation libraries
    such as libXpm. It is utilized by numerous programs, including gkrellm
    and several window managers, to display images.

    <p>
    Pavel Kankovsky discovered that several buffer overflows found in
    the libXpm library (see GLSA 200409-34) also apply to imlib (see GLSA
    200412-03) and imlib2. He also fixed a number of other potential
    security vulnerabilities.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully-crafted
    image file, which would potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code with the rights of the user viewing the image. This affects any
    program that utilizes of the imlib2 library.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All imlib2 users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/imlib2-1.2.0"</code>
  </resolution>
