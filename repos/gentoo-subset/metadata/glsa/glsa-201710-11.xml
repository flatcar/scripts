    <p>A library that provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1, as
      specified by the X.680 ITU-T recommendation) parsing and structures
      management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER, as per X.690) encoding
      and decoding functions.

  <description>
    <p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNU Libtasn1. Please
      review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
      privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or have
      other unspecified impacts.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All GNU Libtasn1 users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-libs/libtasn1-4.12-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
