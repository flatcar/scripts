      <vulnerable range="le">1.7.2</vulnerable>

  <background>
    <p>Thin is a small and fast Ruby web server.</p>

  <description>
    <p>It was discovered that Gentooâ€™s Thin ebuild does not properly handle
      its temporary runtime directories. This only affects OpenRC systems, as
      the flaw was exploitable via the init script.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A local attacker could cause denial of service by killing arbitrary
      processes.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>Gentoo has discontinued support for Thin. We recommend that users
      unmerge Thin:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --unmerge "www-servers/thin"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: The Gentoo developer(s) maintaining Thin have discontinued support
      at this time. It may be possible that a new Gentoo developer will update
      Thin at a later date. There are many other web servers available in the
      tree in the www-servers category.
