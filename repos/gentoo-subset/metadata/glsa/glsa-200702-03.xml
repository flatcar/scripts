  <description>
    <p>
    Randy Smith, Christian Estan and Somesh Jha discovered that the rule
    matching algorithm of Snort can be exploited in a way known as a
    "backtracking attack" to perform numerous time-consuming operations.

  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could send specially crafted network packets, which
    would result in the cessation of the detections and the consumption of
    the CPU resources.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Snort users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-analyzer/snort-2.6.1.2"</code>
