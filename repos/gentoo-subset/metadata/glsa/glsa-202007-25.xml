  <description>
    <p>It was discovered that Gentooâ€™s arpwatch ebuild made excessive
      permission operations on its data directories, possibly changing
      ownership of unintended files. This only affects OpenRC systems, as the
      flaw was exploitable via the init script.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>A local attacker could escalate privileges.</p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All arpwatch users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
      "&gt;=net-analyzer/arpwatch-2.1.15-r11"
    </code>
