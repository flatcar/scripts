  <description>
    <p>A history file in ~/.kedpm/history is written in clear text. All of the
      commands performed in the password manager are written there. This can
      lead to the disclosure of the master password if the “password”
      command is used with an argument. The names of the password entries
      created and consulted are also accessible in clear text.
    </p>

  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>

    <code>
      # emerge --unmerge "app-admin/kedpm"
    </code>
