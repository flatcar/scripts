    <p>
    MySQL is a popular open-source, multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database
    server.

    The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in MySQL:
    </p>
    <p>
    Oleksandr Byelkin found that ALTER TABLE ... RENAME checks CREATE/INSERT
    rights of the old table instead of the new one (CAN-2004-0835). Another
    privilege checking bug allowed users to grant rights on a database they had
    no rights on.
    </p>
    <p>
    Dean Ellis found a defect where multiple threads ALTERing the MERGE tables
    to change the UNION could cause the server to crash (CAN-2004-0837).
    Another crash was found in MATCH ... AGAINST() queries with missing closing
    double quote.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, a buffer overrun in the mysql_real_connect function was found by
    Lukasz Wojtow (CAN-2004-0836).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    The privilege checking issues could be used by remote users to bypass their
    rights on databases. The two crashes issues could be exploited by a remote
    user to perform a Denial of Service attack on MySQL server. The buffer
    overrun issue could also be exploited as a Denial of Service attack, and
    may allow to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the MySQL daemon
    (typically, the "mysql" user).
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=dev-db/mysql-4.0.21"
    # emerge "&gt;=dev-db/mysql-4.0.21"</code>
  </resolution>
