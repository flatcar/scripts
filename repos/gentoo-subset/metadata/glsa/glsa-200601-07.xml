    <p>
    Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported a heap buffer overflow
    vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect boundary check
    of the user-supplied data prior to copying it to an insufficiently
    sized memory buffer. The flaw occurs when the application attempts to
    handle compressed UPX files.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    For example by sending a maliciously crafted UPX file into a mail
    server that is integrated with ClamAV, a remote attacker's supplied
    code could be executed with escalated privileges.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88"</code>
  </resolution>
