Profile settings specific to "dev" images and containers.

Settings here must *ONLY* influence installing binary packages and never
change build time settings like USE or CFLAGS because binary packages
are shared between dev and prod, dev just includes more stuff.

For example, INSTALL_MASK and package.provided are ok.
