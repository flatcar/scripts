- Enabled `systemd-sysext.service` to activate systemd-sysext images on boot, to disable you will need to mask it. Also added a helper service `ensure-sysext.service` which reloads the systemd units to reevaluate the `sockets`, `timers`, and `multi-user` targets when `systemd-sysext.service` is (re)started, making it possible to enable units that are part of a sysext image ([PR#65](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/init/pull/65))
