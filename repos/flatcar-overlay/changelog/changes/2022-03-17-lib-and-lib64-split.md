- For amd64 `/usr/lib` used to be a symlink to `/usr/lib64` but now they became two separate folders as common in other distributions (and was the case for arm64 already). Compatibility symlinks exist in case `/usr/lib64` was used to access, e.g., the `modules` folder or the `systemd` folder ([PR#1713](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/coreos-overlay/pull/1713), [PR#255](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/scripts/pull/255))
