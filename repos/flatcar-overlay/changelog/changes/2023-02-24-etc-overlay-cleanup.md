- On boot any files in `/etc` that are the same as provided by the booted `/usr/share/flatcar/etc` default for the overlay mount on `/etc` are deleted to ensure that future updates of `/usr/share/flatcar/etc` are propagated - to opt out create `/etc/.no-dup-update` in case you want to keep an unmodified config file as is or because you fear that a future Flatcar version may use the same file as you at which point your copy is cleaned up and any other future Flatcar changes would be applied ([bootengine#54](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/54))
