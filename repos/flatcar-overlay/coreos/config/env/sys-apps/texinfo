# texinfo checks if iconv converts EUC-CN encoding to UTF-8. It does
# it by compiling and running a test program, which obviously won't
# fly during cross-compilation. On SDK (for which a native compilation
# is done) the conversion does not happen, so we parrot it for the
# cross-compilation case too.
