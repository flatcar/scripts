# Work around lame function attribute checks when cross-compiling.
# Linker emits a bunch of irrelevant warnings and that trips configure
# script up into thinking that those attributes are not
# supported. Upstream bind-tools already fixed that by being smarter
# and grepping for -Wattributes instead, but we are not yet packaging
# it. We also know that constructor and destructor attributes are
# supported - they are available since at least gcc 3.4.
#
# Drop this when updating to bind tools 9.17.13 or newer.
