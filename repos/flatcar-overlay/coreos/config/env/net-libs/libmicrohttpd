# The usability of the eventfd is tested by linking and running a test
# program, which can't be done when doing a cross-compiliation. So for
# the case of cross-compilation, the configuration scripts assumes
# that eventfd is not usable, which results in confiuration error,
# since usage of eventfd is requested. We know that eventfd is usable
# for us, for tell this to the configure script.
